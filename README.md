This is just a personal music player I made for me, learning Javascript right now and I got bored


Choose an option from the dropdown menu and it will play. Make sure to stop what you're playing first or else it will overlap. Press the Lambda sign to pause your music if it's playing. Or press it again to start your music. The slider is for volume. You will have to let go of the slider for the change to go into effect.

More music will be added eventually ;)


This is the tutorial I used to make the visualizer, you should check it out!
